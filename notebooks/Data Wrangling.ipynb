    "Loans makes for an important source of revnue for retail banks, but it has an associated risk of borrowers defaulting on their loans. Defaulting happens when the borrower stops making required payments on the loan. The purpose of this data science project is to build a predictive model which estimates the probability of default based on customer characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use to train this model is called Customer Loan Data, which has a column indicating if the customer has previously defaulted. Other columns contain information on the borrower as well as some other metrics. We are primarily interested in generating a PD (probability of default) which would be a floating point value between 0 and 1, given the details of the loan as described. We will also note down any other pattern that emerges."
